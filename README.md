The core tasks of APS are modelling and algorithm compilation. To match task outputs, this paper designs a dataset for verifying modelling performance. Based on difficulty, the dataset is divided into basic and complex parts. The basic cases involve the allocation of fundamental production resources with a single decision-making objective, featuring a limited number of decision variables (Nâ‰¤3) and constraints, where the number of decision variables does not exceed the number of constraints. Model types predominantly comprise linear programming formulations. Conversely, the complex cases address intricate production scheduling with a greater quantity of variables and constraints, higher-dimensional characteristics, and model types largely consisting of nonlinear programming formulations. The basic part comprises 66 cases and corresponding models. These include planning and scheduling data for production and manufacturing classes from NL4OPT test set, a benchmark in operations research. The complex part involves 40 cases and corresponding models obtained from classic textbooks, high-quality journal papers and manufacturing researchers.
