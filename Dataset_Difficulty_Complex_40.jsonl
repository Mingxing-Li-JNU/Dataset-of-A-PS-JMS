To complete the processing of workpiece i, ℓi ordered operations must be performed.

Due to its route flexibility, FJSP can be regarded as consisting of many unique JSPs. For example, in a scheduling problem with five workpieces and three machines, where each workpiece has four operations to be processed and each operation can be performed on any two of the three machines, FJSP can be regarded as a set of 220 JSPs. In contrast, JSP only involves a sorting problem because the assignment of operations to machines is predefined. FJSP becomes a problem that requires both route planning and scheduling: assigning each operation Oij to a machine selected from set Mj and scheduling the operations on the machine to minimise the maximum completion time Cmax. The following assumptions apply to the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP): Processing times are known and fixed. Setup times are either negligible or included in processing times.

However, due to limited machine availability and real-time interference, the initial plan needs to be dynamically revised to adapt to actual conditions, resulting in rescheduling. Machine unavailability is primarily caused by machine failures and tool wear, which are considered predictable. During maintenance periods to restore machine availability, the machine cannot process any operations. Other disturbances (e.g., changes in processing time, arrival of emergency jobs) also affect the initial scheduling. Since frequent re-generation of scheduling plans can introduce tension or instability into the scheduling process, efficiency and stability should be considered in each re-scheduling. The dynamic scheduling problem under study is based on the following assumptions: all machines and jobs are available at the start; each job is assigned to at least one machine for processing; each machine can only process one job at a time; an operation cannot be performed until its preceding operation is completed; once an operation begins on a machine, it cannot be interrupted unless the machine becomes unavailable; the processing time for each operation is known in advance but may change during processing; the duration of maintenance required is known.

{"013": "instruction":{},"input":{ {"Case Background":"The parallel machine scheduling problem for tasks with stepwise deterioration, which aims to simultaneously minimise total delay and total energy consumption, is referred to as PMSPSDEC. Consider a set of jobs \( N := \{1, \dots, n\} \) on a set of parallel machines \( M := \{1, \dots, m\} \). Each machine can only process one job at a time, and each job cannot be processed on multiple machines simultaneously. Job interruptions are not allowed. All jobs and machines are available at time zero. Additionally, machine failures and preventive maintenance are not considered in the problem. The temperature of a job decreases while it is waiting to be processed. If the start time \( s_j \) of job \( j \) is less than or equal to its deterioration threshold \( h_j \), its temperature is still suitable for direct processing by the machine, and job \( j \) only requires the processing time \( a_j \). Otherwise, an additional pre-processing penalty time \( b_j \) is required. That is, the actual processing time \( p_j \) of job \( j \) is a step function of its start time \( s_j \) and deterioration threshold \( h_j \). Alternatively, auxiliary equipment (such as an insulated furnace) can be used to maintain the job status so that the machine can start processing as soon as it becomes available, but continuous energy supply is required, and the machine only needs the basic processing time to complete the job. Whether reheating or using insulation equipment, additional energy is consumed. When using auxiliary equipment, the additional energy consumption is calculated as follows: \( E_j = e_0 \times \text{Max}\{0, s_j - h_j\} \), where \( e_0 \) is the unit energy consumption of the auxiliary equipment, and the second part is the waiting time after exceeding the deterioration threshold. On the other hand, if the job does not use auxiliary equipment after exceeding the deterioration threshold, the penalty processing time will increase energy consumption due to its reheating requirements. At this point, the additional energy consumption is determined as \( E_j = q_j \times b_j \), where \( q_j \) represents the unit energy consumption of its penalty processing time. It is important to note that the additional energy consumption \(E_j\) does not include the energy consumption required for the job's basic processing time. The decision problem involves assigning and scheduling jobs to machines and selecting appropriate pre-processing modes.Mathematical modelling of this problem is required. The following objectives must be achieved through the APS system."},{"Objective(s)":"Minimise the weighted sum of total delay cost and additional energy consumption cost. Let \(T_j\) denote the delay time of job \(j\). Using a three-field notation, the problem can be represented as \(Pm|SD,PE|TTC+TEC\). Where \(Pm\) denotes identical parallel machines; in the second field, \(SD\) denotes stepwise deteriorating jobs, and \(PE\) denotes processing energy consumption; in the third field, the scheduling criteria encompass total delay cost (TTC) and total additional energy consumption cost (TEC)."},{"Constraints Dimension":"Constraint (1) ensures that each job is assigned to exactly one machine. Constraint (2) stipulates that if jobs i and j are assigned to the same machine, they cannot be processed simultaneously. Constraint (3) is used to set the start time of each job and ensure that these times are consistent with the sequence variable \(x_{ij}\). The calculation method for the delay time \(T_j\) of each job is given in constraint (4). Constraints (5) and (6) specify that if the start time of job j (\(j \in N\)) is less than or equal to its deterioration threshold (i.e., \(s_j \leq h_j\)), then variable \(z_j = 1\); otherwise, \(z_j = 0\). Constraint (7) ensures that for each \(j \in N\), variables \(u_j\) and \(z_j\) are mutually exclusive, i.e., when \(z_j = 1\), variable \(u_j = 0\); conversely, when \(u_j = 1\), \(z_j = 0\). Constraint (8) is used to calculate the energy consumption for maintaining the job status. If job \(j\) does not use insulation equipment, then constraint (9) sets the additional energy consumption \(e_j\) during the waiting phase to 0. In addition to \(e_j\), the energy consumption resulting from the penalty processing time is determined by constraint (10).
